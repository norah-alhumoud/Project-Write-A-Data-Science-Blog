## Installation <a name="Installation"></a>
There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation <a name="Project_Motivation"></a>
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project.
Since I am a passionate football fan, I choose dataset about FIFA. I want to know many things about it, such as wage of players, rate of player, nationalities, ..... etc.

#### so my question are:

1. What is the distrbuation of player's age?

2. What is the distrbuation of player's height ?

3. What is the distrbuation of player's weight ?

4. Which clubs have the highest average player wage?

5. What is the rate of overall of players?

6. Who is palyer has the highest overall?

## File Descriptions <a name="File_Description"></a>
the csv file contains all data about FIFA19 players, names,age, nationalities, wage, ...... etc.

## Result <a name="Result"></a>
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@norah.mohammed.sa/data-science-blog-post-fifa-2019-dataset-analysis-305f91cab51d).
